—Challenge: Today, CRE brokers, owners, tenants and buyers and sellers often use multiple listing services (MLS) to access property-level data such as location, rental rates, capital values and property features. These platforms are typically subscription-based, commanding high access fees from users.5 The accuracy and detail of property-level data are dependent on the preferences of the brokers, due to a lack of standardized processes and substantive human intervention. This may result in the information being inaccurate, dated or incomplete.6 Further, the search process itself tends to be inefficient, as the data, in general, is fragmented across multiple platforms.7

—Opportunity: A blockchain-based multiple listing service (MLS) could enable data to be distributed across a peer-to-peer network, allowing brokers more control over their data and increased trust, because listings would be more freely accessible.8 Blockchain-based MLS could also provide details on property location and address, comparable rental rates, capital values, ownership history, tenant details, age of the property and title clarity.9 “The result is that participants in a blockchain-enabled MLS market would likely have access to more reliable data at a lower cost,”  observes Eric Piscini, principal and Global Blockchain Financial Services Industry leader, Deloitte Consulting LLP.
